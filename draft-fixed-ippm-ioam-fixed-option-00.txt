                 draft-fixed-ippm-ioam-fixed-option-00

Abstract

   In situ measurement is performed by incorporating performance related
   information into in-flight data packets.  This document specifies a
   new IOAM Option-Type that has a fixed length and can be updated by
   transit nodes along the path.  It enables lightweight monitoring
   using constant-length data that does not depend on the number of hops
   in the network.

1.  Introduction

   In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) [RFC9197]
   is used for measuring and monitoring a network by incorporating
   measurement and operational data into some or all of the data
   packets.  [RFC9197] has defined several Option-Types, intended for
   different purposes.

   This document introduces a new IOAM Option-Type that can be
   incorporated into data packets and updated by transit nodes along the
   path.  Compared to existing IOAM Trace Option-Types, the new Option-
   Type provides coarse-grained performance information using data
   fields that have a constant length.

   There are several in-progress proposals that use a fixed-size
   telemetry header, including [I-D.cxx-ippm-ioamaggr],
   [I-D.mzbc-ippm-transit-measurement-option],
   [I-D.xiao-ippm-ioam-trace-extensions],
   [I-D.filsfils-ippm-path-tracing] and [I-D.ravi-ippm-csig].  These
   proposals can potentially benefit from a generic IOAM Fixed-Length
   Option-Type.

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Terminology

   Abbreviations used in this document:

   IOAM:      In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   OAM:       Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   The terms Option-Type, encapsulating node, decapsulating node, and
   transit node are defined in [RFC9197].

3.  In situ Fixed-Length Option-Type

   This document defines a new IOAM Option-Type, the Fixed-Length
   Option-Type.  Figure 1 presents the format of this Option-Type.

                     Figure 1: Fixed-Length Option-Type

   An IOAM node that complies to this draft MUST support the following
   fields, as depicted in Figure 1:

   Namespace-ID:  A 16-bit namespace identifier, as defined in
      [RFC9197].

   IOAM Fixed-Length-Type  16-bit identifier that specifies which data

      types are used in the Fixed-Length Option-Type.  A new registry is
      defined for this field, as specified in Section 4.

   As in [RFC9197], the Fixed-Length Option-Type can be incorporated
   into all or a subset of the traffic that is forwarded by the
   encapsulating node.  Notably, this option adds a fixed and low
   overhead to data packets, which remains constant along the path.

4.  IANA Considerations

   To be added to a future version of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of IOAM in general are discussed in
   [RFC9197].  The Fixed-Length Option-Type may be used for
   reconnaissance, which in turn can facilitate other types of attacks.
   As in other types of IOAM data fields, a malicious attacker can
   manipulate the field values in order to create a false illusion of
   nonexistent network issues or prevent the detection of actual ones.
